                starts with a need
            </h2>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve
                my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing
                some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell
                phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble)
                made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that
                the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

                <p>You will start seeing things differently and
                    coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                    goals.</p>

                <p>By looking at problems from a different
                    perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more
                    valuable.</p>

                <p>Only when you experience a problem yourself do
                    you understand the frustration of the users and

                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing
                    work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                    You will learn to accept feedback and learn from
                    it.</p>
